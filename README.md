# GameBond

Welcome to the GameBond repo ! This is the result of a one-week workshop at the IFT (La DÃ©fense, France) The goal was to create a gameboy with a small game, that can be played with other players who have a similar gameboy.

We chose a popular french children game, 007, inspired by James Bond. 

## Rules of the game

The rules are simple, you have three possible actions at each turn :

- Reload your gun
- Shoot at an opponent
- Shield yourself (protects you if a bullet is shot at you)

You can only shoot once you have a bullet in your gun, and one bullet kills you if you are not shielded. Obviously, the goal is to be the last to survive ! 

## How to play with the GameBond

All you have to do is plug your GameBond with a USB-C cable on any power source and wait for the other to connect !

## Hardware

The PCB used for this project is detailed in this repository :
